# JavaScriptExample
This Repo is made to learn around the use of javascript

1. Vairables in JS : They are a dynamic allocated since we can change them at run time. JS is a dynamic hence its run time changeable 
2. Var,Const and Let 
        Var - Can be used to define a variable that is in global view to the script so if i use anywhere its gonna take that value 
        let - It is a block statement so if in a scope i use the block statement then i can change it. 
        const - Cannot be changed its always stagnent this helps hence we can use const when we want to make a variable constant and not changeable (this would throw an error).
3. Primitive data types in javascript - there are 7 types of datatypes in JS that is - Null, Number, Symbol, String, Boolean, Bigint, Undefined 
   Objects are a key value string - in python its called as dictionary but in the js its called as objects 
4. Pratice Set: add two number, then we have typeof oprtator to say what type of primitive data type is a variable using , then we can have const  as a fixed/reserved object that cannot be changed anywhere once it is defined but then we can add any new key element to it and at last we learned about the two ways we can access an value in a dict/object.
