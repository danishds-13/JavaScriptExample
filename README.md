# JavaScriptExample
This Repo is made to learn around the use of javascript

1. Vairables in JS : They are a dynamic allocated since we can change them at run time. JS is a dynamic hence its run time changeable 
2. Var,Const and Let 
        Var - Can be used to define a variable that is in global view to the script so if i use anywhere its gonna take that value 
        let - It is a block statement so if in a scope i use the block statement then i can change it. 
        const - Cannot be changed its always stagnent this helps hence we can use const when we want to make a variable constant and not changeable (this would throw an error).
